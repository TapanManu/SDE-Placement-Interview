# #14. Pow(x, n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

```
Input: 2.00000, -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25

Input: 2.00000, 10
Output: 1024.00000
```

**Python (Best - LogN method)**
```python
def myPow(x,n):
    if n < 0:
        x = 1 / x
        n = -n
    pow = 1
    while n:
        if n & 1:
            pow *= x
        x *= x
        n >>= 1
    return pow
```

**Python (Extra)**
```python
def myPow(x,n):
    if abs(x) < 1e-40: return 0 
    if n == 0: return 1
    if n < 0: return myPow(1/x, -n)
    lower = myPow(x, n//2)
    if n % 2 == 0: return lower*lower
    if n % 2 == 1: return lower*lower*x
```

**Explained**
The main idea of solution is to use as much multiplications as possible, for example how can we evaluate x^20? We can just multiply x in loop 20 times, but we also can evaluate x^10 and multiply it by itself! Similarly, x^10 = x^5 * x^5. Now we have odd power, but it is not a problem, we evaluate x^5 = x^2 * x^2 * x. We also need to deal with some border cases, here is the full algorithm:

If we have very small value of x we can directly return 0, the smallest value of float is 1.175494 Ã— 10^(-38).
If we have n = 0, return 1.
If we have negative power, return positive power of 1/x.
Now, we have two cases: for even and for odd n, where we evaluate power n//2.

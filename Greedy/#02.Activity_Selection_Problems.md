# #2. Activity Selection Problems

You are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.

```
Example 2 : Consider the following 6 activities 
sorted by by finish time.
     start[]  =  {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5};
     finish[] =  {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9};
A person can perform at most four activities.
```

**Python**
```python
def printMaxActivities(s,f):
    count = 1
    prev_end = f[0]
    
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] >= prev_end:
            count+= 1
            prev_end = f[i]

    return count
```

**CPP**
```cpp
struct Activitiy 
{ 
    int start, finish; 
};

bool activityCompare(Activitiy s1, Activitiy s2) 
{ 
    return (s1.finish < s2.finish); 
} 
 
void printMaxActivities(Activitiy arr[], int n) 
{ 
    // Sort jobs according to finish time 
    sort(arr, arr+n, activityCompare); 
  
    // The first activity always gets selected 
    int i = 0; 
    cout << "(" << arr[i].start << ", " << arr[i].finish << "), "; 
  
    // Consider rest of the activities 
    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) 
    { 
      if (arr[j].start >= arr[i].finish) 
      { 
          cout << "(" << arr[j].start << ", "
              << arr[j].finish << "), "; 
          i = j; 
      } 
    } 
} 
```

# #6. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.


```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

```


**Python**
```python
def addTwoNumbers3(self, l1, l2):
    carry = 0
    head = cur = ListNode()
    while l1 or l2 or carry:
        if l1:
            carry += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        if l2:
            carry += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next
        cur.next = ListNode(carry%10)
        cur = cur.next
        carry //= 10

    return head.next
```

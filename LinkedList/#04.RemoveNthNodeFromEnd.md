# #4. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.


```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Python**
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    def index(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        i = index(node.next) + 1
        if i > n:
            node.next.val = node.val
        return i
    
    index(head)
    return head.next
```

**Python (SF Pointers)**
```python
def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
    fast = slow = head
    
    for _ in range(n):
        fast = fast.next  
    if not fast:
        return head.next
    
    while fast.next:
        fast = fast.next
        slow = slow.next
    
    slow.next = slow.next.next
    return head
```

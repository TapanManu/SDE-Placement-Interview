# #9. Linked List Cycle

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Python**
```python
def hasCycle(self, head):
    try:
        slow = head
        fast = head.next
        
        while slow is not fast:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return True
    except:
        return False
```

**Python (Not So Best)**
```python
def hasCycle(self, head):
    if not head or head.next is None: return False
    
    i = -82938172983
    while head:
        if head.val <= i: 
            return True
        head.val = i
        i+=1
        head = head.next
    
    return False
```

# #2. Find middle of LinkedList 

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
```

**Python (Fast & Slow Pointers)**
```python
def middleNode(self):
    slow = fast = self.head
    
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow, fast = slow.next, fast.next.next
    
    return slow
```

**Python (Normal)**
```python
def middleNode(self):
    size = 0
    cur = self.head
    
    while cur:
        size += 1
        cur = cur.next

    mid = size//2 + 1
    cur = self.head
   
    while cur:
        if mid - 1 == 0:
            #middle element
            return cur 

        mid -= 1
        cur = cur.next
```

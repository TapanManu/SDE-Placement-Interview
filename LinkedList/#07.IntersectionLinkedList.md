# #7. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
For example, the following two linked lists:

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**CPP**
```cpp
ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
    ListNode *p = headA;
    ListNode *q = headB;

    while (p != q){
        p = p ? p->next : headB;
        q = q ? q->next : headA;
    }

    return p;
}
```

**Python**
```python
def getIntersectionNode(self, a, b):
    p = a
    q = b
    
    while p != q:
        p = a if p is None else p.next
        q = b if q is None else q.next
    
    return p
```

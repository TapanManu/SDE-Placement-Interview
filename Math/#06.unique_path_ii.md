# #6. Unique Paths II

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. <br><br>

How many unique paths would there be?

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2

Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Python**
```python
def countPath(dp):
    m = len(dp)
    n = len(dp[0])

    if dp[0][0] == 1 or dp[-1][-1] == 1:
        return 0

    for i in range(m):
        if dp[i][0] == 1:
            dp[i][0] = 0
            
            for i in range(i+1, m):
                dp[i][0] = 0
            break
        else:
            dp[i][0] = 1
    
    for j in range(1,n):
        if dp[0][j] == 1:
            dp[0][j] = 0

            for j in range(j+1, n):
                dp[0][j] = 0
            break
        else:
            dp[0][j] = 1

    for row in range(1,m):
        for col in range(1,n):
            if dp[row][col] == 1:
                dp[row][col] = 0
            else:
                dp[row][col] = dp[row-1][col] + dp[row][col-1]

    return dp[-1][-1]
```

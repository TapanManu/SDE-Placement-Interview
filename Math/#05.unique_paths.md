# #5. Unique Paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Python (Best)**
```python
def countPath(m,n):
    dp = [1] * n

    for row in range(1,m):
        for col in range(1,n):
            dp[col] += dp[col-1]

    return dp[-1]
```

**Python (Easier to understand)**
```python
def countPath(m,n):
    dp = [[1 for i in range(n)] for j in range(m)]

    for row in range(1,m):
        for col in range(1,n):
            dp[row][col] = dp[row-1][col] + dp[row][col-1]

    return dp[-1][-1]
```

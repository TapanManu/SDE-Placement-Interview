# #05. Find GCD of two numbers

**Python**
```python
def findGCD(a,b):
    if a == 0 : 
        return b  
      
    return findGCD(b%a, a) 
```

**Explained - Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD**<br>
The algorithm is based on below facts.

- If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. 
- So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD. <br>
Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.<br>

## Extended Euclid Algorithm

**Python**
```python
def gcdExtended(a,b):
    if a == 0:
        return b, 0, 1

    gcd, x1, y1 = gcdExtended(b%a, a)

    x1 = y1 - (b//a)*x1
    y1 = x1

    return gcd, x1, y1
```

It explains how extended Euclidean algorithm also finds integer coefficients x and y such that:
```
ax + by = gcd(a, b) 
```

Example
```
Input: a = 30, b = 20
Output: gcd = 10
        x = 1, y = -1
(Note that 30*1 + 20*(-1) = 10)
```

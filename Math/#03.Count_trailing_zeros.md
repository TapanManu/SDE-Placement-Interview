# #3.Count trailing zeros in factorial of a number 

```
Input: 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
```

**Python (Best)**
```python
def trailingZeroes(self, n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    return n/5 + self.trailingZeroes(n/5)
```

**CPP (Best)**
```cpp
int countTrailingZeros(int n) {
	return n == 0 ? 0 : n / 5 + countTrailingZeros(n / 5);
}
```

**Explained**
The idea is:

- The ZERO comes from 10.
- The 10 comes from 2 x 5
- And we need to account for all the products of 5 and 2. likes 4×5 = 20 ...
- So, if we take all the numbers with 5 as a factor, we'll have way more than enough even numbers to pair with them to get factors of 10

Eg. By given number 4617.

5^1 : 4617 ÷ 5 = 923.4, so we get 923 factors of 5<br>
5^2 : 4617 ÷ 25 = 184.68, so we get 184 additional factors of 5<br>
5^3 : 4617 ÷ 125 = 36.936, so we get 36 additional factors of 5<br>
5^4 : 4617 ÷ 625 = 7.3872, so we get 7 additional factors of 5<br>
5^5 : 4617 ÷ 3125 = 1.47744, so we get 1 more factor of 5<br>
5^6 : 4617 ÷ 15625 = 0.295488, which is less than 1, so stop here.<br><br>

Then 4617! has 923 + 184 + 36 + 7 + 1 = 1151 trailing zeroes.

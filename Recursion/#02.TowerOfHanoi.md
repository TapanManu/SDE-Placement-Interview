# #2. Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods (A, B, C) and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.<br>

Input: n = 2
Ouput: 
Move disk 1 from rod A to rod B
Move disk 2 from rod A to rod C
Move disk 1 from rod B to rod C
```

**CPP**
```cpp
void towerOfHanoi(int n, char A = 'A', char B = 'B', char C = 'C') {
	if (n == 1) {
		cout << "Move disk 1 from rod " << A <<
		     " to rod " << C << endl;
		return;
	}

	towerOfHanoi(n - 1, A, C, B);
	cout << "Move disk " << n << " from rod " << A <<
	     " to rod " << C << endl;
	towerOfHanoi(n - 1, B, A, C);
}
```
